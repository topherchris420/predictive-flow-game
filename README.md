# 🧠 PREDICTIVE
### A Game About Knowing Before It Happens

> _"Don’t react. Anticipate."_

**PREDICTIVE** is a 2D experimental resonance game exploring **Predictive Anticipatory Activity (PAA)** — the phenomenon where the brain reacts *before* external events occur.  
It challenges players to enter a flow state where instinct, rhythm, and intuition merge into one predictive field.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- You don’t respond to events — you *pre-spond*.  
- The system generates rhythmic visual and auditory cues (waves, flashes, tones).  
- Your task is to act **before** the pattern unfolds.  
- The closer your timing to the hidden future signal, the stronger your resonance field becomes.  
- Missed predictions alter the game’s waveform, creating new environments to learn from.

As you play, the line between **reaction** and **creation** begins to blur.

## 🧩 Core Features

- **PAA Engine:** Real-time timing analysis that adapts to your anticipatory rhythm.  
- **Dynamic Soundscape:** Music evolves based on how accurately you anticipate.  
- **Resonant Feedback:** Visual cymatic patterns grow from your predictive alignment.  
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** The system learns *you*, not the other way around.  
- **Biofeedback (Optional):** Integrate heartbeat, voice, or breath input for deeper immersion.

## 🧘‍♂️ The Science Behind It

Predictive Anticipatory Activity (PAA) is a measurable pre-stimulus physiological change, often seen in EEG and HRV studies.  
It reflects the mind’s ability to “prepare for” events before they occur — a glimpse into pre-conscious intuition.

This game turns that science into an *experiential playground* for resonance and intuition.
